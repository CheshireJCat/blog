I'm really busy these days.

A few weeks ago, I lost my wallet. Sure, my ID card , bank cards, social security card and others gone.After it, I asked for leave and back home to make an ID card. But there is no way to make others. Because others are all need the ID card that take more than one month before I get it.  

Next is my teeth. When I cleaned them in stomatology hospital. The doctor told me that I have three wisdom teeth. And two of them is cavity. The third is askew, it is  horizontal exactly. One day, I put many millet pepper when I cooked my dinner. 	The next day, I got a sore, and my horizontal tooth got inflammation. It's so painful that I can't stand it. So, I agreed to pull out them without hesitation. So far, I have pull two of them. The last one need professional doctor to deal. But the doctor has no time. So I have to wait for some time.  

At last week, my grandpa passed away. I took a week off work to go home to help my family take care of things. About it, I feel that it's not a bad thing. At least, he will not be tortured by pain.
